# Presentations

Starting with the second of Module 2, one student will be tasked with briefly presenting about a contemporary paper related to the topic we are covering or a topic that will soon be upcoming. The presentation should be on the order of 3-7 minutes and should cover the paper abstract, motivation, solution, and evaluation.

## Paper Sources

The schedule for the first half of the class is fully posted. Review any of the major networking conferences or journals for the past two to three years.  Examples include:

* IEEE INFOCOM (more theory oriented)
* ACM SIGCOMM (more system related)
* IEEE ICNP, NSDI
* Measurement - IMC, PAM
* CoNEXT
* IEEE ICC
* IEEE Globecom
* ACM Computer Communications Review
* IEEE Transactions on Networking
* IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing

as well as many other conferences and journals. For instance, if we are discussing ECN or L4S, you might find the conference program and search for those particular keywords.  Similarly, you might use Google Scholar. Try to avoid survey or tutorial papers.

## Presentation

The goal of the presentation is to cover the paper in sufficient detail to elicit the key points.  You should plan on reading the paper two or three times to try to digest the major points.  You do not need to perfectly understand the paper but should have a very good idea of the main ideas.

For your presentation, you should include the following aspects:

* The overall reference (including a DOI link) and abstract
   * Note that a screenshot of the abstract is just fine
* The main problem
   * Typically the introduction (and the abstract), will capture what the paper is trying to solve
* The proposed solution (roughly)
   * How is the paper solving the problem? What is the key twist?
* The evaluation
   * How did the authors demonstrate that they solved the problem?

For each of these aspects, you are more than welcome to fetch screenshots or excerpts of the papers.  You do not need to redraw, rather you should highlight / emphasize or narrate key parts of the papers.

## Process

Overall, you should plan on doing at three presentations.  The Assignment score on Canvas will have three slots.  The best two out of three scores will be kept for your presentation.  As needed later in the semester, some lectures may have multiple slots for presentations.

Prior to lecture, send the DOI link to Prof. Striegel along with a PDF of your slide deck via e-mail. If you are using Google Slides, please make sure to share the slide deck with Prof. Striegel as well to allow for it to be displayed during lecture.

It is also expected that even if you are auditing the course that you do select three slots for presentations.

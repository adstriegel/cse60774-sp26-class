# Lecture 7 - Handout - 02-04-26 - Grad Networks

## Overview

With a reasonable understanding of ECN and L4S, we will now pivot into the pre-cursor to TCP Prague, namely DCTCP or what is known as DataCenter TCP. As time allows we will continue looking at machine learning for throughput prediction.

## Readings

* Monday (Today) - Lecture 6 - ECN to L4S
   * [Prof Striegel's Notes](../lec06/Notes-Lecture06.pdf)

   * [DCTCP](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1851182.1851192)
   * Optional: [Survey - ML + MP-TCP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10306109)
* Monday - Lecture 8 - QoS / AQM
   * [RED](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/251892)
* Wednesday - Lecture 9 - Quality of Service Architectures
   * [QoS - A Big Picture](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/768484)
   * [DiffServ Performance Evaluation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277052)

## Handouts

* This handout

## Last Lecture - Key Points

* What is ECN? How does it work in general and how does it interplay with TCP?
* What is bufferbloat?  Why does it matter?
* What is L4S? How did it tweak / modify ECN? What does TCP Prague do?

## This Lecture - Key Points

* What makes a datacenter network different from a normal network?
* What are fundamental limitations on switches and routers?
* What is DCTCP and what are its key features?
* What are the key features that are used by the throughput prediction paper? Why are those features relevant?

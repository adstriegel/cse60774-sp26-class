# Lecture 5 - Handout - 01-28-26 - Grad Networks

## Overview

Now onto the still cold, plenty of snow edition.  On Monday, we looked at CUBIC and BBR, two variants of modern CCAs (Congestion Control Algorithms).  In today's lecture, we will continue along that theme, looking at ways to measure performance (FCT) and what complexities multiple paths bring to TCP. We will also discuss Homework 3, the course project, and the paper presentations.

## Readings

* Monday
   * [RFC 3168 - ECN](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.17487/RFC3168)
   * [L4S - TCP Prague](https://www.bobbriscoe.net/projects/latency/tcp-prague-netdev0x13.pdf)
   * [Validting L4S](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3402413.3402419)

## Handouts

* This handout
* [Homework 3](../../hw/hw3.md)
* [Course Project](../../project/overview.md)

## Key Points

* What is FCT? Why is FCT potentially a more appropriate performance measure?
* What makes up the perceived usability of a web page?
* What makes multi-path TCP challenging?

# Lecture 11 - Handout - 02-18-26 - Grad Networks

## Overview

In Lecture 10, we pivoted over from QoS (Quality of Service) to the concept of QoE (Quality of Experience).  In today's lecture, we will continue on the theme of QoE, specifically focusing on DASH, streaming video, and multicast.  We will begin with a primer on DASH and compare it to RTP.  From there, we will look at Pensieve, an approach to delivering QoE for videos, focusing on the problem of adaptation.  Finally, we will wrap up with a look at multicast and brief discussions of how QoS can be challenging for multicast.

## Last Lecture - Key Points

* Why is end-to-end QoS hard?
* What is the major insight from CoDel? Is it knob free or mostly knob free?
* Where is CoDel or for that matter, QoS most relevant?
* What is QoE and how does it differ from QoS?
* What makes capturing QoE hard?

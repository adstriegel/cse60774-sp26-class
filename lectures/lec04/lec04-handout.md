# Lecture 4 - Handout - 01-26-26 - Grad Networks

## Overview

This is the let it snow edition of graduate networks.  While we looked at various physical link properties, we will now look at congestion control.  We will start off with a brief wrap up on the celluar side and then pivot into a broader history of TCP looking at TCP, how the network stack interplays with TCP, and then move into TCP New Reno and TCP Vegas. From there, we will start our discussion of the two papers for the day: CUBIC and BBR.

## Readings

* Wednesday
   * [Flow Completion Time](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1111322.1111336)
   * [Multipath TCP](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2578901)

## Handouts

Handouts for the course project, Homework 3, and the rubric for paper presentations will be distributed on Wednesday.

* This handout

## Key Points

* How does cellular differ primarily from Wi-Fi?
* Describe the differences between: TCP New Reno, TCP Vegas
* What are the major twists brought about by CUBIC? What is the justification for those changes?
* How does BBR operate? How does it differ from CUBIC?

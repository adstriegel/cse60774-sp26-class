# Lecture 8 - Handout - 02-09-26 - Grad Networks

## Overview

In the last lecture, we did a review on ECN / L4S and dived more deeply into the pre-cursor for TCP Prague, namely DCTCP.  We did a brief discussion of the ML for TCP Throughput which we will pick up at the start of lecture today.  From there, we will pivot into RED (Random Early Detection), the foundational paper that effectively launched the entire area of AQM (Active Queue Management).

## Notes

For today's lecture, we will debut a slightly different format - a combination of slides and notes to see if that is a bit more helpful and easier to follow.  The slides will be posted on Canvas under the files and lectures sub-folder.

## Readings

* Wednesday - Lecture 7 - AI / ML for TCP and DCN TCP
   * [Prof Striegel's Notes](../lec07/Notes-Lecture07.pdf)

## Handouts

* This handout

## Last Lecture - Key Points

* What makes a datacenter network different from a normal network?
* What are fundamental limitations on switches and routers?
* What is DCTCP and what are its key features?

## Today's Lecture - Key Points

* *Last Wednesday*: What are the key features that are used by the throughput prediction paper? Why are those features relevant?
* Explain RED at a high level. What is the problem that it is trying to fix?

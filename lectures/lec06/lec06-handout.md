# Lecture 6 - Handout - 02-02-26 - Grad Networks

## Overview

Welcome to February.  In today's lecture, we are going to do a bit of exploring on Wireshark, examining the various field values for the IP and TCP headers to look at ECN.  We will do a bit of a primer on ECN and Bufferbloat to set the stage for L4S and TCP Prague.  The lecture will conclude with a student paper presentation by on the impacts of L4S on cellular networks, more particularly the EPC (Enhanced Packet Core).

We also will do a few tweaks to the lecture format that we will discuss at the beginning of class.

## Handouts

## Key Points

* What is ECN? How does it work in general and how does it interplay with TCP?
* What is bufferbloat?  Why does it matter?
* What is L4S? How did it tweak / modify ECN? What does TCP Prague do?

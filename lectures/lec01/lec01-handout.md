# Lecture 1 - Handout - 01-12-26

In each lecture, there will be a handout generally provided at the start of class. The handout will contain a brief overview of the lecture, links to materials for that lecture, and key points for the lecture.

## Overview

In this lecture, we will cover the normal overview materials including the class syllabus as well as discussing the structure for the course.  We will then continue with an general overview of various networking protocols examining an IoT / wireless-centric cloud configuration.

## Handouts

* Syllabus: Version 1.00 of the syllabus for the course
* Background Survey: A survey to be completed prior to class on Wednesday
* Schedule: The schedule for the course for the first half and tentative topics for the second half
* Handout: This handout

## Scenario - Smart Home

Consider the following setup.  A home owner has set up a smart home containing a Ring doorbell, a set of smart lights on the porch.  The home owner has the Ring app installed on their mobile phone and is driving home. A package is dropped off at the front door and the owner gets a push notification on their phone with a still image of the deliver drivery walking up the sidewalk.  The detection of a person triggers the front porch lights turning on since it is after dusk.

What are the protocols / technologies that deliver the push notification and turn on the smart lights?

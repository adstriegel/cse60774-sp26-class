# Lecture 3 - Handout - 01-21-26 - Grad Networks

## Overview

Last Wednesday, we started off with a discussion of general link properties and moved into the fundamentals of TCP.  In today's lecture, we will focus once again on key link types, exploring various kinds of wired and wireless links that will set the foundation for the rest of the course.

## Readings

While there are no readings for today's lecture, lectures going forward will typically have one or two readings associated with the lecture.  You should plan on having read each paper twice to enable a robust paper discussion during the lecture.  While we will discuss the paper and its core concepts during lecture, it will be most helpful for you to bring a hand annotated or electronically annotated version to lecture.

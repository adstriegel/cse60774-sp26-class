# Lecture 12 - Handout - 02-23-26 - Grad Networks

## Overview

With Lecture 11, we wrapped up the QoS / multimedia module, our first paper centric module for the course.  With the second module (three lectures), we will explore wireless networking, specifically Wi-Fi (today), cellular (Wednesday), and ad hoc networks (next Monday).  In today's lecture, we will look at Wi-Fi fundamentals with a paper written by numerous luminaries in the field of Wi-Fi including our very own Prof. Ghosh from Electrical Engineering at Notre Dame. We will start off with a deeper tutorial and Wi-Fi and then focus on a few of the key twists / additions to Wi-Fi.

# Schedule for ND CSE 60774 - Spring Semester

## First Half

The first half of the class will consist of four modules:

* **Module 1: Introduction:** An introductory module covering key aspects of undergraduate networks with a broader focus on building / reinforcing concepts relevant to the concepts covered later in the course.
* **Module 2: Congestion Control:** A focus on the evolution of TCP with a specific focus on modern Congestion Control Algorithms (CCAs) including CUBIC and BBR
* **Module 3: Quality of Service / Quality of Experience:** An examination of how QoS evolved into QoE and how instrumentation is undertaken to evaluate QoS / QoE within a network
* **Module 4: Wireless:** Fundamentals of how WiFi and cellular have evolved as exploring ad hoc networking

Starting with the second module and beyond, specific lectures will have slots for student-led presentations where a contemporary research paper will be presented by one or more students in the class.  The topic will be loosely aligned with recently covered material or the topics in that module.

Noted assignments will include:

* The in-class presentation as noted above
* An in-class mid-term exam to be held on March 4th - open note
* A course project proposal due at the end of Module 3
* A literature survey on the three primary content modules due just before spring break

## Second Half

The second half of the class will be posted roughly halfway through the first part of the semester.  The tentative topic / module list is as follows:

* **Module 5: Content Distribution:** Coverage of multicast, content distribution networks (CDNs), named-data networking, and intent-based networking
* **Module 6: Cyber-Physical Systems:** Sensor networks, Internet of Things, edge computing, vehicular networks, interim student presentations
* **Module 7: Contemporary Topics:** Software defined networking (SDN), datacenter networking, mesh networking
* **Module 8: Project Presentations:** Final project presentations

Noted assignments will include:

* The in-class presentation as noted above
* An intermediate presentation about the course project
* A final project presentation
* A take-home final exam and an accompanying in-person oral exam
* A final project research paper

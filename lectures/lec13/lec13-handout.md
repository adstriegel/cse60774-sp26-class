# Lecture 13 - Handout - 02-25-26 - Grad Networks

## Overview

In Lecture 12, we shifted focus over to wireless networking, specifically Wi-Fi.  We got roughly halfway through the content on Wi-Fi and will continue with that content today along with a look at cellular networks, specifically the evolution of cellular networks looking at 5G and Beyond.  We will have a bit of acronym soup today as well looking at the components of the cellular network and what they mean / how they are related to connectivity for end users.

## Last Lecture - Key Points

* Explain why the following aspects matter for Wi-Fi: unlicensed spectrum, channel width
* Explain the evolution of Wi-Fi from Wi-Fi 1 (802.11b) through Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be).

## This Lecture - Key Points

* *From last lecture:* What is OFDMA? How does it differ from FDMA, TDMA, etc.?
* *From last lecture:* What is frame aggregation and how does it help?
* *From last lecture:* What is MIMO?
* How does cellular differ from Wi-Fi?
* Compare / contrast: UE, eNodeB, SGW, PGW, RAN, WLAN, SIM.
* What are notable changes with Releases 15, 16, and 17?
